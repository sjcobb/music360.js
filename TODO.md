## TODO

- [ ] AI duet - figure out machineKeyDown timing (use Tone.Transport.scheduleRepeat?)
- [ ] note length as addBody -> sphereRestitution or initContactMaterial restitutionValue param?
- [ ] new drum machine wheel / metronome paradigm - use rotating clock hand to hit drums: https://codepen.io/danlong/pen/LJQYYN
- [ ] instrument animations mapped to note sequences, ex: flamePhysics.create triggered on FD - FD -- A3F - A3F added to note sequence (use humanKeyAdds array? or buildNoteSequence function)
- [ ] Fix audio quality in recordings
- [ ] Keep camera in line with ballX position
- [ ]
- [ ] UI for editable 'instrument - shape - note - keyboard' mapping object
- [ ] Other shapes besides spheres - each shape has different sound / wave type
- [ ] Contact surfaces light up based on note color
- [ ] Clean up instrumentMapping template and getters
- [ ] Different contact surfaces with different restitution
- [x] Web MIDI API support to connect to keyboard
- [x] Dynamically set zPos based on note position in staff (position.z in instrumentMapping getter)
- [x] Fix Fire class and shader import
- [x] Arrow key controls
- [x] support PolySynth in getInstrumentMappingTemplate to allow chords
- [x] variation added for striped balls
- [x] configurable static row positioning of ball array using globalShowStaticRows
- [x] dynamic associatation of keyName with keyMapped options for dropped balls
- [x] set fill styles from instrumentMapping obj instead of THREEx.createPoolBall
- [x] How to drop balls without stacking?
